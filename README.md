# Capflag
A Multiplayer Capture The Flag Game


This is a re-make of an old Game Maker game I created many years ago.


# Compile
To compile the game, make sure you have MinGW 10.2.0 installed on your system

Set the compiler path in the build.bat file if the compiler is not setup in the environment variables.

Run build.bat
